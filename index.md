# Project Description
Manoa parking app that will make parking on UH easier. First allows users to input their owned parking passes into a profile.  Then the user could use an interactive map that will allow them to see where they can park at which times of the day.  App will also have a system where users can input open parking spaces allowing for other users to know where there is open parking.

# Community Feedback
The application was popular amongst those we asked for feedback and they agreed it was something they might use. They said they particularly liked the slider feature so that it is more convenient for when they need to find parking at the current time of day. They said it could be improved by adding our planned feature of saying when a parking spot is open and/or having the slider start at the current time of day.The map itself was visually appealing and conveyed where parking was available to be clear.
