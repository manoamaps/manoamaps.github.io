# Project Description
Manoa parking app that will make parking on UH easier. First allows users to input their owned parking passes into a profile.  Then the user could use an interactive map that will allow them to see where they can park at which times of the day.  App will also have a system where users can input open parking spaces allowing for other users to know where there is open parking.
